Tired of your brilliant deep-tech breakthrough getting blank stares from VCs? This command-line tool translates your pitch into VC-friendly B2B SaaS jargon they actually want to hear.

> **Disclaimer:** This is a parody tool. Using this in a real pitch might get you laughed out of the room... or it might get you funded. Who knows anymore?

### The Problem It Solves

It helps you turn your honest, technical pitch...

`"Our new material is lighter and stronger."`

...into a VC-ready pitch that sounds like this:

`"We've developed a proprietary, AI-driven materials discovery platform to create next-generation composites, disrupting the $500B legacy manufacturing sector. Our hyper-scalable, cloud-native solution provides a 10x improvement in strength-to-weight ratios, creating an unassailable moat. We're pre-revenue but are projecting a $15M ARR by Q4."`
